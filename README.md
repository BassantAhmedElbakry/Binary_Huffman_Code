# Information Theory
## Source coding:
- Binary Huffman code
- Binary Fano Code
## Channel coding:
Assume you want to transmit 110000 information bits using:
- BPSK with no coding
- BPSK with repetition 3 coding, and use hard decision decoding
- BPSK with repetition 3 coding, and usesoft decision decoding
- BPSK with a (7,4) Hamming code
- BPSK with a (15,11) Hamming code
  
Assume you want to transmit 26200000 bit using:
- QPSK with no coding
- 16 QAM but utilizing a (255,131) BCH code
Convolutionally encode 1000 bits by the (2,3,K) code described by:
<br />g1 (1)=[0 1] 
<br />g2 (1)=[1 1] 
<br />g1 (2)=[1 1] 
<br />g2 (2)=[1 0] 
<br />g1 (3)=[0 0] 
<br />g2 (3)=[1 1]
